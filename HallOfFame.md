ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Crozwords and i want to introduce you to a fun discord event running for all of 2023!!! 

**INTRODUCING** - **HALL OF FAME**

So what is it? Starting FRESH in 2023, this is a Tournamnet Discord specific event where you can compete amongst the community to try to hold 
as many mon-specific records as possible under the KAIZO IRONMON ruleset. You can also **WIN CROZ's MONEY.** This event will run from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. Who will reign as the 
greatest record holder in the server??!!??

The purpose of this event is to help grow the server and the community as a whole. In increments of 10$, CROZ is offering 10x the number of discord 
members by December 31, 2023. Currently 20$ (200 dc members) to the person who holds the MOST individual pokemon records, PER GAME. Games offered are FRLG, Emerald, Platinum, 
HGSS, and BW. So tell your friends, get them interested and the prize pool will go up!

Every mon will have it's own unique RECORD HOLDER, based on most completed milestones. 

To see the current record holders, see http://bit.ly/3Q5jTEm <br>

| What mons count? | + All mons that CANNOT evolve further are in the list. Stone evo mons are also included, since it is a choice on whether or not to use the stone. <br> + For submission purposes - the  only mon that counts is the one you are running when it faints. <br> + Since the official discord for Ironmon rules also allows 1 legendary of sub 600 BST, those mons are also included in the HOF listing.|

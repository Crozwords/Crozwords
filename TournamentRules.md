## Tournament Randomizer String Settings:
For the settings strings, we recommend using [**something_smart_'s edited randomizer**](https://github.com/something-smart/ironmon-randomizer) which will give competitors enhanced settings to speed up seed times. Formats below with **(Smart)** are only compatible with something_smart_'s randomizer and will have access to increased friendship values. Competitors using the most up-to-date randomizer from the official IronMON Discord server will want to use the strings with **(4.6.0)**.
| **Format** | **String** |
|-|-|
| HeartGold **(4.6.0)** | 321WRIEEgKYAJsAngCRAAKeBhsEiAEAFAACCQAuEgAAAAAADBCI5ATkQYgICTIGBQIyAAUYFVBva2Vtb24gSGVhcnRHb2xkIChVKeynOO3jwziK |

## Seasonal Tournament Modifiers:
Each season, there are modifiers selected which slightly change the way the tournament seeds are played. The current season's modifiers can be found below.
| **Modifier** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Pickpocket the Professor **(All Formats)** | *Must have latest Tournament patch* (**#tourny-resources channel** in the Discord Server, or the "Patch Your Rom" Global rule below) Receive a Master Ball in addition to the normal 5 Pok√© Balls at the beginning of each seed. It may be used at any time. |
| One TM Mon **(All Formats)** | Learn one TM at the time of acquisition **(ONLY ONE)** but must forfeit the ability to learn/re-learn any other moves for the rest of the seed. There is to be no passing by TMs to backtrack later in the seed. Once you have passed through a route, TMs on that route are no longer accessible if not collected. |
| Setup Loses **(All Formats)** | Using a setup move which increases ATK or SPA and does not deal damage results in -1 point from the total score while in Gyms, E4 & Champion battles. This applies to any permanent stat increasing move (EVA+, Accupressure, etc.)  |

## Global "CORE" Tournament Rules
**Rules which apply to the tournament as a whole. Any additional rules for other modes will be noted below this table.**
| **Rule** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Have Fun!üôÇ | This tournament has brought together a lot of streamers and their communities. It's all about having fun and enjoying the experience!|
| 10 Seeds Per Round | 	Each player will complete 10 seeds within the week. |
| Make Time For Seeds | 10 seeds must be completed in the 1 week window. If the seeds are not completed, the score will be considered final at the closing of the round. Times are based on your local timezone. i.e. Round 1 will conclude *specified day* at 11:59pm. |
| Patch Your Rom | **HeartGold:** https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/HGSSModifiers/releases/tag/v0.1.1 <br> **FireRed:** https://github.com/DrMaple/FireRed-Tourney-Patch/releases/tag/FireRedTourneyS12 |
| Lab Ball Choice | To help promote competetive balance, all 10 seeds will be 'lab choice' where each competitor exams each ball and chooses their starter. |
| Legendary Lab Clauses | As of S7 - Legendaries will be banned from the lab due to competitive inequality for those that face them on rival vs. those that do not. |
| Catch & Release | You **MUST NOT** abuse catching and releasing. Only naturally obtained Pok√© Balls can be used for catching and releasing. You cannot buy balls to use for catch & release. When releasing, you are not to look at stats. We want to iterate that this is not a huge deal, just try your best not to abuse viewing stats. |
| Sketch & Poison Heal | You may not obtain a move from Sketch from a wild Pok√©mon, or farm for poison moves from wild Pok√©mon if you have the ability *Poison Heal*. Sketch's overall power is very high - and in a tournament setting instead of hand-picking a move and spending hours finding it - you now have to weigh the cost of carrying an empty move slot and waste a turn in a trainer battle to teach. Poison Heal is the same - if you are poisoned with poison heal in a trainer battle, or incidentally on a wild, you may keep the status until you decide to heal. You may, under no circumstances, farm wild patches to obtain the poison status. |
| No Guard + OHKO | The combination of the ability "No Guard" with One Hit Knock Out moves is banned from tournament play. |
| Trapping Rule | Before the Rival 1 battle, if a mon traps you and 0 Pok√© Balls have been found, you may kill the mon. This CANNOT be exploited purposefully. If you picked up a Pok√© Ball, you MUST attempt to catch and release or pivot- your intentions must also be declared. If you catch and release, you may not look at the info for the Pok√©mon. |
| Seed Visibility | Please have a visible note somewhere on your stream layout which indicates the seed you are currently running. (E.g. Tourney Seed #1) |
| Score Hand-In | Upon completion of your stream, the player must post seed scores in the **#tourny-score-submit channel**. Please use the correct format so organizers can update the spreadsheet as fast as possible. |
| Gen 3 Point Tracker | <br> Find the update [**here**](https://github.com/UTDZac/CrozwordsTourney-IronmonExtension/releases/latest). <br> <br> ![Gen3PointTracker](https://github.com/Crozwords/Crozwords/blob/main/Gen3PointTracker.png) |
| Gen 4 Point Tracker | <br> Please update the tracker and find the extension in the "Extras" page. <br> <br> ![Gen4PointTracker](https://github.com/Crozwords/Crozwords/blob/main/Gen4PointTracker.jpg) |
| 100% TMs  | Another variance to promote competetive balance, is 100% TM compatibility. However, you are only allowed to teach two (2) Gym Leader TMs in your entire seed. If a run makes it to Kanto, you unlock one (1) additional TM to teach. Non-Gym-Leader TMs and all HMs are still illegal unless a seasonal modifier declares it legal. |
| Tie Event | In the event of a tie, the player who had the furthest run will be declared the winner. Full clear bonus points ARE NOT milestones. If players are still tied, a 1-seed sudden death play-off will be completed to determine the winner. Players will still have lab choice for the ball. The first player to complete the Rival 1 battle sets the distance to beat. The player with the most completed milestones will be declared the winner. |
| Evolution Bonus Points | Successfully evolving a Pok√©mon through natural level-up will earn you bonus points towards your tournament score (Items/Friendship evolutions will not count). |
|| **Evolution Bonus Points Structure:** HGSS: Lvl 0-19 (+2) -- Lvl 20-29 (+3) -- Lvl 30+ (+5) -- FRLG Lvl 0-19 (+3) -- Lvl 20-29 (+6) -- Lvl 30+ (+8) |
|| You are limited to TWO (2) evolution bonuses per seed. All evolution targets must come from Route 29, 30, 31, 32, 46, Sprout Tower, Ruins of Alph, Dark Cave, Rock Smash/Headbutt/Fishing locations PRE-Union Cave. Evolution bonus is NOT AVAILABLE to new pivots during or after Union Cave. |
|| Pok√©mon who evolve after the lab battle (Rival 1) are **not eligible for bonus points**. |
| Kaizo Luck Clause | One guaranteed trip to Falkner/Brock. If all 9 of your first runs fail to make it, you may repeat seed generation until a seed makes it here. <br> ~We want everyone who signs up to be able to actually play the game. Kaizo happens, this just helps to slightly mitigate that. |

## FireRed Specific Rules
**Extra rules specific to FRLG**
| **Rule** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Guaranteed Run Clause | Each player is guaranteed 10 seeds exit the lab. If you faint in the lab, you re-randomize and try again. |
|| Players MUST attempt to click moves that make sense (i.e. most powerful/status etc), any attempts to throw lab purposefully will result in DQ. We understand that skissues happen, but **REMEMBER** it's meant to be fun, embrace the RNG. |
| Evolution Bonus Points | You are limited to TWO (2) evolution bonuses per seed. All evolution targets must come from Route 1, 22, 2 and Viridian Forest PRE-Gym 1. |
| Kaizo Luck Clause | One guaranteed trip to Brock. If all 9 of your first runs fail to make it, you may repeat seed generation until a seed makes it here. |
| Early Balls | Pok√© Balls are obtained as soon as the player leaves Pallet Town. Please use the [**provided patch**](https://github.com/DrMaple/FireRed-Tourney-Patch/releases/tag/FireRedTourneyS12) which prevents (now illegal) progression. It also includes some neat QoL updates to help players in their runs. |
| No Heals Clause | Any seed which does not contain a legal HP restoring item of any kind before Brock may purchase **1** Potion from the shop. |
| Misty Before Leaving | Players **MUST** defeat Misty before progressing south. Bridge and trainers and trainers North of Cerulean are still permitted before Misty. Bridge and Route north of bridge are permitted, the NPC blocks the path through the house to head south of Cerulean. |
| Erika Before Flute | Players **MUST** defeat Erika before obtaining the Pok√© Flute. |
| Move Relearner | Players now have access to a Move Reminder NPC on outside Rock Tunnel (Cerulean side), who takes Heart Scales as currency. |

## Partners HeartGold Rules
**Extra rules specific to HGSS partners format**
| **Rule** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| PLAYER 1 and PLAYER 2 | Both players will be completing idential seeds. **PLAYER 1** Your job is to scout the seed and provide information and resources to the PLAYER 2. PLAYER 2 will have the advantage of knowing what your partner encountered. Your job as a team is to communicate and work together to score the MOST CUMULATIVE MILESTONE + BONUS POINTS. All information exchanged is legal. Logs are not to be viewed until both PLAYER 1 and PLAYER 2 have completed the seed. |
|| The person who goes 1st does not have to be the same for all seeds. This is encouraged. PLAYER 1 creates the seed and then shares the seed# and setting string code from the log to PLAYER 2. <br> PLAYER 1 seed creation instructions: https://imgur.com/a/ltpZ5Oh |
|| HOWEVER, both players may NOT run the same Pok√©mon. This also applies to pivot mons. If PLAYER 1 catches a pokemon to pivot to, and examines its stats, PLAYER 2 may NO LONGER PIVOT to that mon when they run the seed. |
|| All teams will have the SAME LAB MONS but will have otherwise completely randomized SEEDS. i.e. you and your partner will have the same grass etc. however, your opponent will only have the same lab as you and will otherwise be completely different. |
| Plate Gifting | **PLAYER 1** has the ability to pass on resources to PLAYER 2 through plates. As you progress through your seed, you will accumulate PLATES. At any point in your seed, prior to an overworld battle OR entering a dungeon, you can GIFT the plates to the second player. They simply must declare "IM GIFTING xNumber of PLATES TO MY PARTNER", then trash them from their inventory. Then PLAYER 2 can redeem the plates for heals as if they had them in their correlating seed. THIS MUST BE THE SAME SEED NUMBER. Players **must purchase** the items and cannot be supplied them in the lab (as of S10 seasonal modifier). Each Plate is worth 10HP in healing items. |
|| **PLAYER 2's** redemption of the plates is a 1-time purchase of healing items = to x10 the number of plates you have been gifted. E.g. you were gifted 10 plates, you can exchange them for 100pts of healing, however you choose. (5 Potions... or 2 Super Potions, etc.) *note* You must progess far enough to be able to purchase your preferred potions. i.e. Super Potions only unlock after obtaining 1st badge. |
| Admin Lab Creation | Prior to each round of the tournament, the coordinator or an Admin will randomly run 10 lab seeds and provide the listed mons to each team. Those mons will be identical for all players for the round however each team's PLAYER 1 will do the unique randomization, then share the seed number and string code with their Partner. |

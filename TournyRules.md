| Rule | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Have Fun!üôÇ | This tournament has brought together a lot of streamers and their communities. It's all about having fun and enjoying the experience!|
| 10 Seeds Per Round | 	Each player will complete 10 seeds within the week. |
| Make Time For Seeds | 10 seeds must be completed in the 1 week window. If the seeds are not completed, the score will be considered final at the closing of the round. Times are based on your local timezone. i.e. Round 1 will conclude *specified day* at 11:59pm. |
| Lab Ball Choice | 	To help promote competetive balance, all 10 seeds will be 'lab choice' where each competitor exams each ball and chooses their starter. |
| Legendary Lab Clauses | 	As of S7 - Legendaries will be banned from the lab due to competitive inequality for those that face them on rival vs. those that do not. |
| Sketch and Poison Heal |You may not obtain a move from Sketch from a wild pokemon, or farm for Posion moves from wild pokemon if you have the ability *Poison Heal*. Sketch overall power is very high - and in a tournament setting instead of hand-picking a move and spending hours finding it - you now have to weigh the cost of carrying an empty move slot and waste a turn in a trainer battle to teach. Poison Heal is the same - if you are poisoned with poison heal in a trainer battle, or incidentally on a wild, you may keep the status until you decide to heal. You may under no circumstance farm wild patches to obtain the poison status. |
| Trapping Rule | 	Before the Rival 1 battle, if a mon traps you and 0 Pok√© Balls have been found, you may kill the mon. This CANNOT be exploited purposefully. If you picked up a Pok√© Ball, you MUST attempt to catch and release or pivot- your intentions must also be declared. If you catch and release, you may not look at the info for the Pok√©mon |
| Seed Visibility | 	Please have a visible note somewhere on your stream layout which indicates the seed you are currently running. (E.g. Tourney Seed #1) |
| Score Hand-In | 	Upon completion of your stream, the player must post seed scores in the #Tourny-Score-Submit channel. Please use the correct format so admins can update the spreadsheet as fast as possible.|
| 100% TMS | 	Another variance to promote competetive balance, is 100% tms compatibility. However, you are only allowed to teach two(2) gym leader TMs in your entire seed. If a run makes it to Kanto, you unlock one (1) additional TM to teach. Non-gym leader TMs and HMs are still illegal. |
| Tie Event | 	In the event of a tie, the player who had the furthest run will be declared the winner. Full clear bonus points ARE NOT milestones. If players are still tied, a 1-seed sudden death play-off will be completed to determine the winner. Players will still have lab choice for ball. The first player to complete the Rival 1 battle sets the distance to beat. The player with the most completed milestones will be declared the winner. 
| Evolution Bonus points | Successfully evolving a Pok√©mon through natural level-up  will earn you bonus points towards your tournament score (Items/Friendship evolutions will not count)  
|                        | **Evolution Point Structure:** Bonus structure: Lvl 0-19 (+2) -- Lvl 20-29 (+3) -- Lvl 30+ (+5)|
|                        | You are limited to TWO (2) evolution bonuses per seed. All evolution targets must come from Route 29, 30, 31, 32, 46, Sprout Tower, Ruins of Alph, Dark Cave, Rock Smash/Headbutt/Fishing locations PRE-Union Cave. Evolution bonus is NOT AVAILABLE to new pivots during or after Union Cave. 
| Kaizo Luck Clause | If you do not beat the first rival battle in ANY of your FIRST 9 attempts, you can re-randomize seed #10 as a Choice Seed until Rival 1 is cleared. |

|                        | **Evolution Point Structure:** Bonus structure: Lvl 0-19 (+2) -- Lvl 20-29 (+3) -- Lvl 30+ (+5)|

All evolution targets must come from Route 29, 30, 31, 32, 46, Sprout Tower, Ruins of Alph, Dark Cave, Rock Smash/Headbutt/Fishing locations PRE-Union Cave. Evolution bonus is NOT AVAILABLE to new pivots during or after Union Cave. 
| PLAYER 1 and PLAYER 2 | Both players will be completing idential seeds. **PLAYER 1** Your job is to scout the seed and provide information and resources to the PLAYER 2. PLAYER 2 will have the advantage of knowing what your partner encountered. Your job as a team is to communicate and work together to score the MOST CUMULATIVE MILESTONE + BONUS POINTS. All information exchanged is legal. Logs are not to be viewed until both PLAYER 1 and PLAYER 2 have completed the seed. |
|                        | The person who goes 1st does not have to be the same for all seeds. This is encouraged. PLAYER 1 creates the seed and then shares the seed# and setting string code from the log to PLAYER 2. PLAYER 1 seed creation instructions: https://imgur.com/a/ltpZ5Oh |
|                        | HOWEVER, both players may NOT run the same pokemon. This also applies to pivot mons. If PLAYER 1 catches a pokemon to pivot to, and examines it's stats, PLAYER 2 may NO LONGER PIVOT to that mon when they run the seed. |
|                        | All teams will have the SAME LAB MONS but will have otherwise completely randomized SEEDS. i.e. you and your partner will have the same grass etc.. however your opponent will only have the same lab as you and will otherwise be completely different. |
| Plate Gifting | **PLAYER 1** has the ability to pass on resources to PLAYER 2 through plates. As you progress through your seed,  you will accumulate PLATES. At any point in your seed, prior to an overworld battle OR entering a dungeon,  GIFT the plates to the second player. They simply must declare IM GIFTING xNumber of PLATES TO MY PARTNER, then trash them from their inventory. Then PLAYER 2 can then redeem the plates for heals as if they had them in their correlating seed. THIS MUST BE THE SAME SEED NUMBER.
|               | **PLAYER 2's** redemption of the plates is a 1-time purchase of healing items = to 10x the number of plates you have been gifted. EX: you were gifted 10 plates, you can exchange them for 100pts of healing, however you choose. (5 potions..or 2 Super potions, etc.) *note* You must progess far enough to be able to purchase your preferred potions. i.e. super potions only unlock after obtaining 1st badge.
| Admin Lab Creation | Prior to each round of the tournament, the coordinator or an Admin will randomly run 10 lab seeds and provide the listed mons to each team. Those mons will be identical for all players for the round however each team's PLAYER 1 will do the unique randomization, then share the seed number and string code with their Partner. |

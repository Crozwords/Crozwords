**FRLG Kaizo Tourny Rules** 
| Rule | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Have Fun!üôÇ | This tournament has brought together a lot of streamers and their communities. It's all about having fun and enjoying the experience!|
| 10 Seeds Per Round | 	Each player will complete 10 seeds within the week. |
| Guaranteed Run Clause | If you do not beat the first rival battle in ANY of your FIRST 7 attempts, you can re-randomize seed 8 through 10, with lab choice, until Rival 1 is cleared. |
| Make Time For Seeds | 10 seeds must be completed in the 1 week window. If the seeds are not completed, the score will be considered final at the closing of the round. Times are based on your local timezone. i.e. Round 1 will conclude *specified day* at 11:59pm. |
| Lab Ball Choice | 	To help promote competetive balance, all 10 seeds will be 'lab choice' where each competitor exams each ball and chooses their starter. |
| Legendary Lab Clauses | Legendaries will be banned from the lab due to competitive inequality for those that face them on rival vs. those that do not. |
| Sketch |You may not obtain a move by using Sketch on a wild pokemon. Sketch overall power is very high - and in a tournament setting instead of hand-picking a move and spending hours finding it - you now have to weigh the cost of carrying an empty move slot and waste a turn in a trainer battle to teach.|
| Trapping Rule | If a mon traps you have 0 Pok√© Balls, you may kill the mon. This CANNOT be exploited purposefully. If you are trapped and have Pok√© Balls, you MUST attempt to catch and release or pivot- your intentions must also be declared. |
| Seed Visibility | 	Please have a visible note somewhere on your stream layout which indicates the seed you are currently running. (E.g. Tourney Seed #1) |
| Score Hand-In | 	Upon completion of your stream, the player must post seed scores in the #Tourny-Score-Submit channel. Please use the correct format so admins can update the spreadsheet as fast as possible. (Seed # - Death location - Variable information - bonus information ). |
| 100% TMS | 	Another variance to promote competetive balance, is 100% tms compatibility. However, you are only allowed to teach one(1) gym leader TM in your entire seed. Non-gym leader TMs and HMs are still illegal. |
| Tie Event | 	In the event of a tie, the player who had the furthest run (as per the milestone list) will be declared the winner. Full clear bonus points ARE NOT milestones. If players are still tied, a 1-seed sudden death play-off will be completed to determine the winner. Players will still have lab choice for ball. The first player to complete the Rival 1 battle sets the distance to beat. The player with the most completed milestones will be declared the winner. 
| Evolution Bonus points | Successfully evolving a Pok√©mon through natural level-up  will earn you bonus points towards your tournament score (Items/Friendship evolutions will not count)  
|                        | **Evolution Point Structure:** Bonus structure: Lvl 0-19 (+2) -- Lvl 20-29 (+3) -- Lvl 30+ (+5)|
|                        | You are limited to TWO (2) evolution bonuses per seed. All evolution targets must come before fighting brock.
